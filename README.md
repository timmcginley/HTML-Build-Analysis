# HTML-Build-IFC-Converter

## What?
Super basic attempt to read an IFC file using ifcopenshell and save it as an [HTML-BUILD](https://github.com/timmcginley/HTML-Build) file. 

## Why?
IFC is an awesome interoperable data model, it therefore contains a lot of data and relationships that can be intimidating to those starting off, but it is hackable. Creating a simpler HTML version (as a super minimal BIM) using custom HTML entities gives someone starting off in BIM with a chance to hack their own building Information model

## Can I try?
Sure, best way to start is to grab the repo and then run duplex.py as the main.py references files that aren't included in this repo.

## Can I help?
Sure, my (tim's) coding skills are crappy but enthusistic, more skilled contributions, are definately welcome :)

## Whats next?

WriteBack - write the data back to IFC step file format? possible but would we want to?
Template - Use this idea to develop a templating system for BIM projects.
Plan - display a plan to the right side that the user could click a floor to select.
CSS View - develop multiple CSS files for different use cases.
Desktop - iframe the output into a comparison of multiple files.
Compare - Compare different files?
SVG - perhaps could write the geometric aspects within the DIV as SVGs?
