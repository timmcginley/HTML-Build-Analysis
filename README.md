# HTML-Build-Analyser

## What?
Based on [HTML-Build-IFC-Converter](https://github.com/timmcginley/HTML-Build-IFC-Converter), this repo focuses on the disciplinary analysis needs and hwo this could be satisfied using only HTML5 principles and technologies.

## Why?
IFC is an awesome interoperable data model, it therefore contains a lot of data and relationships that can be intimidating to those starting off, but it is hackable. Creating a simpler HTML version (as a super minimal BIM) using custom HTML entities gives someone starting off in BIM with a chance to hack their own building Information model. The other repos provide generic solutions, but this one hopes to build an analysis focused system.

## Can I try?
Sure, best way to start is to grab the repo and then run duplex.py as the main.py references files that aren't included in this repo.

## Can I help?
Sure, my (tim's) coding skills are crappy but enthusistic, more skilled contributions, are definately welcome :)

## Whats next?

- adapt the model and view definitions in HTML to represent a 2 x 2 grid.
